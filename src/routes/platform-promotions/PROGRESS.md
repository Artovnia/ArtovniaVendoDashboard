# Global Platform Promotions - Implementation Progress

## Overview
Implementation of global promotions system where:
- Admin creates promotion campaigns 
- Vendors can view available global promotions
- Vendors can opt-in by adding their products to promotions
- System enforces security - vendors can only add their own products

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Custom API routes in `/api/vendor/platform-promotions`
- **Frontend**: React components with hooks for API communication
- **Security**: Vendor ownership validation for product additions
- **Data Flow**: Admin creates â†’ Vendor views â†’ Vendor adds products â†’ Promotion updated

## Implementation Checklist

### Backend API Routes (/api/vendor/platform-promotions)
- [ ] `GET /` - List available global promotions for vendor
- [ ] `GET /:id` - Get specific promotion details
- [ ] `POST /:id/products` - Add vendor products to promotion
- [ ] `DELETE /:id/products` - Remove vendor products from promotion
- [ ] Middleware for vendor authentication and authorization

### Frontend Hooks (/hooks/api)
- [ ] `usePlatformPromotions()` - List global promotions
- [ ] `usePlatformPromotion()` - Get single promotion
- [ ] `useAddProductsToPromotion()` - Add products mutation
- [ ] `useRemoveProductsFromPromotion()` - Remove products mutation

### Frontend Components (/routes/platform-promotions)
- [ ] `platform-promotions-list.tsx` - Main listing page
- [ ] `platform-promotion-detail.tsx` - Detail/edit page for single promotion
- [ ] `components/platform-promotion-card.tsx` - Promotion card component
- [ ] `components/product-selector.tsx` - Product selection component

### Navigation & Routing
- [ ] Add routes to router provider
- [ ] Add navigation item to main layout
- [ ] Update route map configuration

### Translations
- [ ] English translations (en.json)
- [ ] Polish translations (pl.json) 
- [ ] Schema updates ($schema.json)

## Current Status
ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Setting up project structure and backend routes

## Issues & Notes
- Need to ensure vendor can only add their own products
- Promotion rules need to be merged, not replaced
- Consider campaign budget implications for multi-vendor participation
- UI should clearly show which products vendor has already added

## Next Steps
1. Create backend API routes with proper security
2. Implement frontend hooks for API communication
3. Build React components for promotion management
4. Add navigation and translations
